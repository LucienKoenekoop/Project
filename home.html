	  	<div class="well"><h2>Employment Description</h2></br>
			Short Description: The employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 20 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group. The indicator is based on the EU Labour Force Survey. The survey covers the entire population living in private households and excludes those in collective households such as boarding houses, halls of residence and hospitals. Employed population consists of those persons who during the reference week did any work for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent.
		</div>
	  	<div class="well"><h2>R&D Description</h2></br>
			Short Description: The indicator provided is GERD (Gross domestic expenditure on R&D) as a percentage of GDP. "Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications" (Frascati Manual, 2002 edition, § 63 ).
		</div>
	  	<div class="well"><h2>Asylum Description</h2></br>
			Short Description: The indicator shows the number of first-time asylum applicants per million inhabitants and the number of positive first instance decisions per million inhabitants. Please note that caution is required when comparing these two values, since applications received in a given year might not be processed until a later year. Source data are supplied to Eurostat by the national Ministries of Interior and related official agencies.
		</div>
	  	<div class="well"><h2>Education Descritpion</h2></br>
			Short Description: The indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 30-34 who have successfully completed tertiary studies (e.g. university, higher technical institution, etc.). This educational attainment refers to ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) 2011 level 5-8 for data from 2014 onwards and to ISCED 1997 level 5-6 for data up to 2013. The indicator is based on the EU Labour Force Survey.
		</div>
	  	<div class="well"><h2>Emission Description</h2></br>
			Short Description: This indicator shows trends in total man-made emissions of the ‘Kyoto basket’ of greenhouse gases. It presents annual total emissions in relation to 1990 emissions
			The ‘Kyoto basket’ of greenhouse gases includes: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the so-called F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, nitrogen triflouride (NF3) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)). These gases are aggregated into a single unit using gas-specific global warming potential (GWP) factors. The aggregated greenhouse gas emissions are expressed in units of CO2 equivalents. The indicator does not include emissions and removals related to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); nor does it include emissions from international maritime transport. It does however include emissions from international aviation. CO2 emissions from biomass with energy recovery are reported as a Memorandum item according to UNFCCC Guidelines and not included in national greenhouse gas totals. 
			The EU as a whole is committed to achieving at least a 20% reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990. This objective implies:
			- a 21 % reduction in emissions from sectors covered by the EU ETS (emission trading scheme) compared to 2005 by 2020; 
			- a reduction of 10 % in emissions for sectors outside the EU ETS. To achieve this 10% overall target each Member State has agreed country-specific greenhouse gas emission limits for 2020 compared to 2005 (Council Decision 2009/406/EC).
		</div>
	  	<div class="well"><h2>Healthcare Description</h2></br>
			Short Description: The indicator is a subjective measure on how people judge their health in general on a scale from ‘very good’ to ‘very bad’. The data stem from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC). Indicators of perceived general health have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use and mortality.
			The indicator is expressed as percentages within (or share of) the population and breakdowns are available by sex, age group, labour status, educational attainment level, and income quintile group.
