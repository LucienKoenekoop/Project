# Problem Statement
Nowadays there is a lot of discussion in Dutch politics: leave or stay in the European Union. But in fact a lot of ambiguity is noticable among the Dutch population about what the EU exactly does, and what role it plays for the Netherlands and the Netherlands plays for it. To clearify this ambiguity the idea is to make an interactive visualization about the EU: about what topics revolves European politics and which amounts of money are involved. 

# Solution
This visualization will give insight in the acts of the EU and thus contribute to bring more nuance about European politics among the Dutch voters.
